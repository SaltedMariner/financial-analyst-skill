## Buy-Side Analysis Framework

### Screening & Initial Assessment
1. **Strategic fit**: Revenue synergies, market expansion, vertical integration, talent acquisition
2. **Financial profile**: Revenue, EBITDA, margins, growth rate, capital intensity
3. **Valuation range**: Quick EV/EBITDA and EV/Revenue multiples vs. industry benchmarks
4. **Deal capacity**: Affordability check against acquirer's balance sheet and debt capacity

### Financial Model Components (Buy-Side)
```
1. Standalone Target Model
   - Historical financials (3-5 years)
   - Normalized/adjusted EBITDA
   - Working capital analysis (NWC peg)
   - CapEx requirements (maintenance vs. growth)
   - Projected financials (3-5 years forward)

2. Synergy Model
   - Revenue synergies (cross-sell, price, market expansion) — discount heavily, phase in over 2-3 years
   - Cost synergies (headcount, facilities, procurement) — higher confidence, achieve in 12-18 months
   - Integration costs (one-time: severance, systems, rebranding)
   - Net synergy timeline and NPV

3. Transaction Model
   - Sources & Uses (purchase price, fees, financing)
   - Pro-forma balance sheet (combined, post-transaction)
   - Goodwill and purchase price allocation
   - Accretion/dilution analysis (public acquirers)
   - Pro-forma credit metrics (leverage, coverage)

4. Returns Analysis
   - IRR to acquirer under base/upside/downside cases
   - Sensitivity on purchase multiple, synergies achieved, and exit timing
   - Payback period on investment
```

### Key Buy-Side Metrics
- Maximum purchase price at target return threshold
- Implied EV/EBITDA at various offer prices
- Pro-forma leverage (Debt/EBITDA) post-close
- Synergy breakeven (minimum synergies to justify price)
- Accretion/dilution timeline

## Sell-Side Analysis Framework

### Preparation Phase
1. **Quality of Earnings (QoE)**: Normalize EBITDA for non-recurring, owner-specific, and pro-forma items
2. **Adjusted EBITDA bridge**: Walk from reported EBITDA to adjusted — every add-back must be defensible
3. **Growth story**: Revenue trajectory, backlog, pipeline, market tailwinds
4. **Working capital normalization**: Determine target NWC for purchase agreement

### Sell-Side Financial Model
```
1. Historical Analysis (3-5 years)
   - Revenue bridge (volume, price, mix, new customers)
   - Margin trend analysis with explanations
   - Working capital seasonality and normalized level
   - CapEx history (maintenance vs. growth)
   - Cash flow conversion analysis

2. Adjusted EBITDA Schedule
   - Start: Reported EBITDA
   - Add-backs: Owner compensation above market, one-time expenses,
     non-recurring items, related party adjustments, pro-forma cost saves
   - Result: Adjusted/Run-Rate EBITDA (the "marketed" number)

3. Forward Projections (Management Case)
   - Base case: Conservative, achievable
   - Management case: Upside with credible support
   - Revenue and EBITDA growth supported by specific drivers
   - Demonstrate operating leverage

4. Valuation Support
   - Comparable company multiples
   - Precedent transaction multiples
   - DCF with sensitivity analysis
   - Value creation potential for buyer (shows why premium is justified)
```

### Key Sell-Side Metrics
- Adjusted EBITDA with full add-back schedule
- Revenue and EBITDA CAGR (trailing and projected)
- Customer concentration (top 10 customers as % of revenue)
- Revenue visibility (recurring vs. one-time %)
- Margin expansion opportunity
- Defensible competitive advantages

## Valuation Methodologies

### Comparable Company Analysis (Comps)
1. Select peer universe: Same industry, similar size, growth, margins
2. Calculate current trading multiples: EV/EBITDA, EV/Revenue, P/E
3. Determine relevant range (25th-75th percentile)
4. Apply to target metrics (LTM and NTM)
5. Apply illiquidity discount for private targets (15-30%)

### Precedent Transaction Analysis
1. Identify relevant transactions: Same industry, similar size, recent (3-5 years)
2. Calculate transaction multiples: EV/EBITDA, EV/Revenue at close
3. Note control premiums embedded in prices
4. Adjust for market conditions at time of transaction
5. Apply range to target

### Discounted Cash Flow (DCF)
1. Project unlevered free cash flows (5-10 year explicit period)
2. Calculate terminal value (exit multiple or perpetuity growth)
3. Discount at WACC
4. Sum PV of projected cash flows + PV of terminal value
5. Subtract net debt → implied equity value
6. Sensitivity table on WACC and terminal growth/exit multiple

### Valuation Summary (Football Field)
Present all methodologies side-by-side:
```
                          Low        Mid        High
Comparable Companies     5.0x       6.5x       8.0x
Precedent Transactions   6.0x       7.0x       8.5x
DCF Analysis            $XX M      $XX M      $XX M
LBO (Floor Valuation)    4.5x       5.5x       6.5x
```

## Transaction Structuring

### Sources & Uses Table
```
SOURCES                          USES
Senior Debt       $XX M          Enterprise Value    $XX M
Mezzanine Debt    $XX M          Transaction Fees    $XX M
Seller Note       $XX M          Financing Fees      $XX M
Equity (Buyer)    $XX M          Working Capital Adj $XX M
Rollover Equity   $XX M          Escrow/Holdback     $XX M
─────────────────────────       ─────────────────────────
Total Sources     $XX M          Total Uses          $XX M
```

### Purchase Price Adjustments
- **Net Working Capital Adjustment**: Actual NWC vs. target (peg) at close; dollar-for-dollar adjustment
- **Net Debt Adjustment**: Debt-free/cash-free basis; buyer assumes no debt, seller retains excess cash
- **Earnout**: Contingent consideration tied to future performance milestones
- **Escrow/Holdback**: Portion held back (10-15%) for indemnification claims
- **Seller Note**: Deferred payment, typically 10-20% of purchase price

### Working Capital Peg Methodology
1. Calculate NWC for each of the trailing 12 months
2. Exclude seasonality spikes and anomalies
3. Compute trailing 12-month average as the peg
4. Define NWC components (include/exclude items)
5. Set collar (band around peg where no adjustment occurs, typically ±1-2%)
