## Standard Pro-Forma Structure

### Income Section
```
Potential Gross Income (PGI)
  Base Rental Income (by unit type or tenant)
  Rent Escalations (annual % or CPI-based)
  Percentage Rent (retail properties)
- Vacancy & Collection Loss (% of PGI, market-specific)
+ Other Income (parking, laundry, storage, CAM reimbursements, late fees)
= Effective Gross Income (EGI)
```

### Operating Expense Section
```
Property Taxes (actual or projected with escalation)
Insurance
Utilities (owner-paid portion)
Repairs & Maintenance
Property Management Fee (% of EGI, typically 3-8%)
Administrative / General
Landscaping & Snow Removal
Common Area Maintenance
Marketing / Leasing Costs
Reserves for Replacement (per unit or % of EGI)
= Total Operating Expenses
```

### NOI and Below-the-Line
```
Effective Gross Income
- Total Operating Expenses
= Net Operating Income (NOI)

- Debt Service (P&I)
= Before-Tax Cash Flow (BTCF)

- Capital Expenditures (non-recurring)
- Tenant Improvements
- Leasing Commissions
= Net Cash Flow After CapEx
```

### Pro-Forma Projection Period
- Standard: 5, 7, or 10-year hold periods
- Include: annual escalation assumptions for revenue and expenses
- Reversion/sale: apply exit cap rate to terminal year NOI
- Deduct: disposition costs (typically 2-3% of sale price)
- Calculate: equity multiple, IRR, cash-on-cash by year

### Key Pro-Forma Metrics to Output
- NOI by year, Cap Rate (going-in and exit), Cash-on-Cash Return, Levered/Unlevered IRR, Equity Multiple, DSCR by year, Average Cash Yield, Peak Equity, Profit on Sale

## Pro-Forma Assumptions

### Revenue Assumptions
- **Market Rent**: Current market rate per SF or per unit
- **Rent Growth**: Annual escalation (2-3% typical, or CPI + spread)
- **Vacancy Rate**: Market-specific, typically 3-10% stabilized
- **Absorption Period**: Months to reach stabilized occupancy (lease-up deals)
- **Concessions**: Free rent, TI allowances during lease-up
- **Renewal Probability**: % of tenants expected to renew (65-80% typical)

### Expense Assumptions
- **Expense Growth**: Annual escalation (2-3% or CPI-based)
- **Management Fee**: % of EGI (self-managed vs. third-party)
- **Replacement Reserves**: Per unit ($250-500/unit/year typical) or % of EGI
- **Property Tax Reassessment**: Model reassessment upon sale in applicable jurisdictions

### Financing Assumptions
- **Loan-to-Value**: 60-80% (conventional)
- **Interest Rate**: Current market rate, fixed vs. variable
- **Amortization**: 20-30 years typical
- **Loan Term**: 5-10 years (balloon at maturity)
- **Debt Service**: Monthly P&I calculated from loan terms
- **Loan Fees**: Origination (0.5-1%), closing costs

### Exit/Reversion Assumptions
- **Hold Period**: Years until disposition
- **Exit Cap Rate**: Typically 25-50 bps higher than going-in cap rate
- **Disposition Costs**: 2-3% of sale price (broker, legal, transfer taxes)
- **Capital Gains Tax**: If applicable (model pre-tax and after-tax returns)

## Investor Waterfall Structures

### Structure 1: Simple Preferred Return + Promote

The basic waterfall with a single preferred return hurdle.

```
Tier 1: Return OF Capital
  - All distributions go to LP until 100% of contributed capital is returned

Tier 2: Preferred Return
  - All distributions go to LP until they have received [X]% IRR (typically 6-10%)
  
Tier 3: GP Catch-Up
  - All (or a portion of) distributions go to GP until GP has received
    their proportionate share of total profits

Tier 4: Residual Split
  - Remaining distributions split (e.g., 70% LP / 30% GP or 80/20)
```

**Parameters**: Preferred return rate, catch-up percentage, promote split, compounding method (simple vs. compound, annual vs. monthly)

### Structure 2: Multi-Tier Waterfall

Multiple return hurdles with escalating GP promote.

```
Tier 1: Return OF Capital
  - 100% to LP until all contributed capital returned

Tier 2: Preferred Return (Hurdle 1)
  - 100% to LP until [8]% IRR achieved

Tier 3: First Promote Split
  - [70]% LP / [30]% GP until [12]% IRR achieved

Tier 4: Second Promote Split
  - [50]% LP / [50]% GP until [18]% IRR achieved

Tier 5: Third Promote Split
  - [20]% LP / [80]% GP on remaining distributions
```

**Common configurations**:
- 2-tier: 8% pref → 70/30 split
- 3-tier: 8% pref → 70/30 → 50/50
- 4-tier: 8% pref → 70/30 → 50/50 → 20/80

### Structure 3: GP/LP with Catch-Up and Clawback

Full institutional waterfall with GP catch-up and clawback provisions.

```
Tier 1: Return OF Capital
  - 100% to LP until all contributed capital returned

Tier 2: Preferred Return
  - 100% to LP until [8]% preferred return (cumulative, compounding)

Tier 3: GP Catch-Up
  - [100]% to GP until GP's share equals [20]% of total profits
    distributed in Tiers 2 and 3
    (This "catches up" the GP to their promote percentage)

Tier 4: Residual Split
  - [80]% LP / [20]% GP on all remaining distributions

Clawback Provisions:
  - At fund liquidation, if GP has received more than their entitled share
    (due to early distributions exceeding final performance), GP must
    return the excess to LPs
  - Typically secured by GP escrow (30-50% of carry held back)
  - True-up calculation performed at final disposition
```

**Key details**:
- **Catch-up percentage**: Typically 50% or 100% to GP
- **100% catch-up**: GP receives 100% of distributions until caught up
- **50% catch-up**: GP receives 50%, LP receives 50% until caught up
- **Clawback trigger**: When actual returns fall below modeled returns after all assets are disposed
- **Escrow**: Portion of GP distributions held back pending final true-up

## Waterfall Calculation Methodology

### Step-by-Step Calculation Process

1. **Build the cash flow timeline**: Map all equity contributions (negative) and distributions (positive) by period
2. **Track cumulative invested capital**: Running balance of unreturned capital
3. **Calculate preferred return accrual**: Period-by-period preferred return on unreturned capital
4. **Allocate distributions through tiers**: Apply each dollar of distribution to the highest-priority unfunded tier
5. **Track IRR at each hurdle**: Use IRR to determine which tier applies at each distribution point
6. **Handle catch-up**: If applicable, allocate to GP catch-up after preferred return is satisfied
7. **Apply lookback/clawback**: At final disposition, true-up total distributions to ensure compliance

### Compounding Conventions
- **Simple preferred return**: Preferred = Capital × Rate × Time (no compounding)
- **Annual compound**: Preferred compounds annually on unreturned capital
- **Monthly compound**: More LP-favorable; preferred compounds monthly
- **Cumulative vs. non-cumulative**: Cumulative accrues unpaid preferred; non-cumulative does not

### IRR-Based vs. Return-Based Hurdles
- **IRR-based hurdles**: Distribution tiers trigger based on LP IRR (time-weighted, accounts for contribution timing)
- **Return multiple-based**: Tiers trigger based on equity multiple (e.g., 1.0x return of capital, 1.5x first hurdle)
- **Preferred return-based**: Tiers based on cumulative preferred return being satisfied

### Multi-Asset / Fund-Level Considerations
- **Deal-by-deal waterfall**: Each investment has its own waterfall calculation
- **Whole-fund waterfall**: Waterfall applies to aggregate fund performance (European-style)
- **American vs. European**: American = deal-by-deal carry; European = whole-fund carry after return of all capital
- **Recycling**: Returned capital from early exits reinvested before triggering waterfall

### Implementation Notes for Excel
- Use separate columns for each tier's allocation per period
- Track running LP IRR using XIRR function on actual dates
- Use MAX/MIN formulas to cap tier allocations
- Build a distribution "waterfall" tab that flows left-to-right through tiers
- Include sensitivity tables on key assumptions (exit cap rate, hold period, rent growth)
- Provide a summary dashboard showing LP IRR, equity multiple, GP promote total
