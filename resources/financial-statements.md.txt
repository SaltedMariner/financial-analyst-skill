## Income Statement Analysis

### Standard Structure
```
Revenue / Net Sales
- Cost of Goods Sold / Cost of Revenue
= Gross Profit
- Selling, General & Administrative (SG&A)
- Research & Development
- Depreciation & Amortization (if not in COGS)
= Operating Income (EBIT)
+ Other Income / (Expense)
- Interest Expense
= Pre-Tax Income (EBT)
- Income Tax Expense
= Net Income
```

### Key Analysis Points
- **Revenue quality**: Recurring vs. one-time, customer concentration, organic vs. acquired growth
- **Gross margin drivers**: Input costs, pricing power, product mix, labor efficiency
- **SG&A leverage**: Fixed vs. variable components, scaling with revenue
- **Below-the-line items**: Separate operating performance from capital structure and tax effects
- **Earnings quality**: Cash earnings vs. accrual adjustments, non-recurring items

## Balance Sheet Analysis

### Standard Structure
```
ASSETS                              LIABILITIES & EQUITY
Current Assets:                     Current Liabilities:
  Cash & Equivalents                  Accounts Payable
  Accounts Receivable                 Accrued Expenses
  Inventory                           Current Portion of LTD
  Prepaid Expenses                    Deferred Revenue (current)
  Other Current Assets                Other Current Liabilities

Non-Current Assets:                 Non-Current Liabilities:
  Property, Plant & Equipment         Long-Term Debt
  Intangible Assets                   Deferred Tax Liabilities
  Goodwill                            Other Long-Term Liabilities
  Other Non-Current Assets
                                    Shareholders' Equity:
                                      Common Stock
                                      Retained Earnings
                                      AOCI
                                      Treasury Stock
```

### Key Analysis Points
- **Asset quality**: Aging of receivables, inventory obsolescence, PP&E condition, goodwill impairment risk
- **Liability completeness**: Off-balance-sheet items, operating leases (ASC 842), contingent liabilities
- **Working capital adequacy**: Current ratio, quick ratio, NWC trends
- **Capital structure**: Debt-to-equity, maturity schedule, fixed vs. variable rate mix
- **Book value vs. fair value**: Particularly for real estate, equipment, and intangibles

## Cash Flow Statement Analysis

### Standard Structure (Indirect Method)
```
Operating Activities:
  Net Income
  + Depreciation & Amortization
  + Stock-Based Compensation
  + Other Non-Cash Items
  - Gain on Asset Sales
  Changes in Working Capital:
    - Increase in AR / + Decrease in AR
    - Increase in Inventory / + Decrease in Inventory
    + Increase in AP / - Decrease in AP
    + Increase in Accrued / - Decrease in Accrued
= Cash from Operations (CFO)

Investing Activities:
  - Capital Expenditures
  - Acquisitions
  + Proceeds from Asset Sales
  - Purchases of Investments
= Cash from Investing (CFI)

Financing Activities:
  + Debt Borrowings
  - Debt Repayments
  + Equity Issuance
  - Dividends Paid
  - Share Buybacks
= Cash from Financing (CFF)

Net Change in Cash = CFO + CFI + CFF
```

### Key Analysis Points
- **CFO vs. Net Income**: Quality of earnings; persistent divergence is a red flag
- **CapEx classification**: Maintenance vs. growth CapEx (critical for FCF)
- **Working capital trends**: Are changes sustainable or one-time?
- **Free cash flow conversion**: FCF / Net Income ratio (>80% is strong)
- **Cash allocation**: How is FCF used — deleveraging, dividends, buybacks, growth CapEx, M&A?

## Ratio Analysis Framework

When performing ratio analysis, organize ratios into categories and provide context:

### Category Sequence
1. **Profitability**: Gross margin → Operating margin → Net margin → EBITDA margin → ROE → ROA → ROIC
2. **Liquidity**: Current ratio → Quick ratio → Cash ratio → Operating CF ratio
3. **Leverage**: Debt/Equity → Debt/EBITDA → Net Debt/EBITDA → Interest coverage → FCCR
4. **Efficiency**: Asset turnover → AR turnover → Inventory turnover → Cash conversion cycle
5. **Valuation** (if applicable): EV/EBITDA → EV/Revenue → P/E → P/B

### Presentation Standards
- Show 3-5 years of trend data for each ratio
- Include industry benchmarks or peer comparisons when available
- Flag ratios outside normal ranges with directional commentary
- Show DuPont decomposition when ROE analysis is relevant
- Always pair profitability ratios with cash flow quality metrics

## Variance Analysis Framework

### Budget vs. Actual Variance Structure
```
                    Budget      Actual      Variance    Var %     Favorable/Unfavorable
Revenue             $X          $X          $X          X%        F/U
COGS                $X          $X          $X          X%        F/U
Gross Profit        $X          $X          $X          X%        F/U
  Gross Margin %    X%          X%          Xbps
Operating Expenses  $X          $X          $X          X%        F/U
  [by category]
Operating Income    $X          $X          $X          X%        F/U
```

### Variance Decomposition
- **Revenue variance**: Volume × Price × Mix analysis
- **COGS variance**: Material price × Material usage × Labor rate × Labor efficiency × Overhead
- **SG&A variance**: Headcount × Compensation × Discretionary spending
- **Margin variance**: Identify whether margin changes are driven by revenue mix, cost changes, or both

### Reporting Best Practices
- Sort variances by absolute magnitude (largest first)
- Provide root cause explanation for material variances (>5% or >$X threshold)
- Distinguish controllable vs. uncontrollable variances
- Include year-over-year and sequential (month-over-month) comparison
- Project full-year impact of YTD variances

## Common-Size Analysis

### Income Statement (Vertical)
Express all line items as % of revenue. Enables comparison across companies of different sizes and across periods.

### Balance Sheet (Vertical)
Express all items as % of total assets. Reveals capital allocation and financing structure.

### Horizontal Analysis
Express each line item as % of base year (index to 100). Reveals growth trends and structural shifts.

## Trend Analysis

### Multi-Period Analysis
- Minimum 3 years; prefer 5 years for meaningful trends
- Calculate CAGR for key metrics
- Identify inflection points and structural changes
- Separate organic trends from acquisition effects
- Normalize for one-time items before trending

## QuickBooks Export Processing

### Common Export Formats
- **Profit & Loss (Detail/Summary)**: CSV/Excel export from Reports → Standard
- **Balance Sheet (Detail/Summary)**: CSV/Excel export
- **Trial Balance**: Most useful for detailed account-level analysis
- **General Ledger**: Transaction-level detail
- **AR/AP Aging**: Customer/vendor-level detail

### Processing Steps
1. **Clean headers**: QuickBooks exports often have multi-row headers, date ranges, and company name rows — strip to single header row
2. **Normalize accounts**: Map QB account names to standard financial statement categories
3. **Handle sub-accounts**: QB uses indented sub-accounts (e.g., "Utilities:Electric") — parse hierarchy
4. **Class/Location handling**: If multi-entity or departmental, pivot by class or location
5. **Accrual vs. Cash**: Verify basis; QB allows both — confirm with user which is exported
6. **Reclassify if needed**: Owner draws → distributions, loan proceeds → financing, intercompany → eliminate

### Common QB Data Issues
- Uncategorized income/expenses in "Ask My Accountant" or "Uncategorized"
- Misclassified items (e.g., equipment purchases in expenses vs. fixed assets)
- Missing depreciation entries (cash-basis clients)
- Unreconciled bank balances
- Intercompany transactions not eliminated
